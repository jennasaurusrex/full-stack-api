## ABOUT RECIPE JOURNAL

This is my first full stack project! I have created a log book of sorts where you can keep track of recipes you admire and update them with relevant information! You can also see all of the recipes created by any user that has used this website! Thanks for checkin' it out.

## TECHNOLOGIES IN USE

- JavaScript
- Ruby
- Rails
- AJAX
- jQuery
- Handlebars
- CSS/Bootstrap

## PLANNING & DEVELOPMENT

I had a fairly easy time coming up with an idea for this project. The problem was that I had so many ideas and not enough time or resources to complete them. I'll definitely be returning to this project and adding some features in the near future. This time around the project fairly depicts the wireframes I think, and I'm proud of sticking to them!

## UNSOLVED PROBLEMS

I never got around to adding a comment section to rate and/or add tips to other people's recipes. I also never got around to making a search bar, which was kind of the highlight of my project (or so I thought) going into this.
